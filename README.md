# The-structure-of-Tanzania-Twitter-network
This project is focused on a comprehensive analysis of Tanzania's Twitter social network. It involves systematically measuring network statistics and a comparative study with Twitter networks in the USA, Japan, and Brazil. The project also incorporates a network formation model, specifically the friend-of-a-friend model, to simulate the structural attributes of the Tanzania Twitter network.
